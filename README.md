# Supplementary Python Code for "A New Law of the Wall at High Reynolds Numbers"

This repository contains a Python script that supplements the manuscript:

**Durst, Heyder & Zanoun**, *A New Law of the Wall at High Reynolds Numbers for ZPG Boundary Layers and Plane-Channel Flows*, [Journal Reference].

The code provides calculations, data processing, and visualization routines used to support the analysis presented in the paper. 
It is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in turbulent boundary-layer and channel-flow modeling.

## Usage

Run the provided Python file `nlw.py` directly. Ensure that all dependencies listed in the header of the script are installed. The NLW-data can be exported to excel via the last two lines.
